  <h1>Dot-AI<br> Enhancing Chrome with AI</h1>

</div>
-   Developed a Chrome extension that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Large Language Models into the browser to enhance search.
-   Utilizes Google's search engine as the retrieval system, and the search results as the content.

## Implementation
### Frontend

-   Used Chrome's extension API, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to integrate the extension into the search engine.

### Backend

-   Used Cohere's LLM/API in the backend to synthesize information retrieved from Google search results.
-   Used FastAPI build a backend API.
